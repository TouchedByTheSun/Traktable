<h2>Please read</h2>
<p>If your using OS X Lion or higher you can skip this notification. Just update and enjoy. If not and your running this app on Snow Leopard I've got some bad news. The trakt.tv api seems to respond with a different kind of JSON responses then before. The JSON parser I used can't read them and to keep the project easy to maintain I switched to Apple's builtin JSON parser. The bad news is, it's only builtin from OS X Lion.<br><br>
I'm sure there are not many Snow Leopard users left, but if your are one of those and would love to keep this app running please contact me. I'll try to make some time to build a Snow Leopard version is anyone wants to but for now I'm guessing It's not necessary.
